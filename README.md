# Surfs up

## Overview of the statistical analysis

The current project analyzes data of Hawaii weather in order to study the possibility of opening a shop serving surfboards and ice cream to locals and tourists in this beautiful island. We have to take in account the precipitation as well, due to the fact that there needs to be enough rain to keep everything green, but not so much so it can be ideal for surfing and to have an ice cream.

This was performed with the main objective of attracting investors with visualizations of a full year of data. 

The tools used for display this analytics were Jupyter Notebook File and SQLite database.  

## Results 

As we can see in the description of June and December weather:

1. The mean results between the two months are not highly variable, this means the expectation of similar temperatures during the year. 

2. The standard deviation is approximately 4 degrees, this represents a low variability of the weather as a whole. 

3. The minimum temperature in the island is 56 during December, so it is not extremely low, that is why we could expect tourists and surfers this month as well, so it means people all year round in Hawaii. 


## Summary 

### Suggestion of aditional analysis 

Besides the previous one, the team would like to implement a market research to know if there are some specific stores that rent or sell accesories and equipment for sea activities and perform an analysis to know what percentage of our target audience is local and how many are tourists.

The second statistic based on this as well, will be the minimum and maximum expected inventory according to the demand in the points of the island our shops are gonna be instaled.

### Target Market 


### Key next steps 

After sharing the visualizations with the potential investors, the next step is the act phase, in this one we will be using all the numbers and results we retrieved to start the performance of the project planning. One advantage of the queries we performed is that this can be used in the future to apply these analysis to more regions of Hawaii, in case the shareholders would like to open more shops in the short or long term, deppending upon the success of the first ones.
