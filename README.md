1. The mean results between the two months are not highly variable, this means the expectation of similar temperatures during the year. 

2. The standard deviation is approximately 4 degrees, this represents a low variability of the weather as a whole. 

3. The minimum temperature in the island is 56 during December, so it is not extremely low, that is why we could expect tourists and surfers this month as well, so it means people all year round in Hawaii. 


## Summary 

Besides the previous analysis, the team would like to know if there are some specific stores that rent or sell accesories and equipment for sea activities and perform an analysis to know what percentage of our target audience is local and how many are tourists.
The second statistic based on this as well, will be the min and max expected inventory according to the demand in the points of the island our shops are gonna be instaled.
